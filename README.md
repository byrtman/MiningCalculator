A calculator app that helps Star Citizen miners determine the value of rocks before deciding to mine them.


**TODO:**
1. Calculate chunk value for main screen.
1. Calculate total value for all runs on main screen.
1. Prevent adding empty chunks
1. Change chunk Id at right time, so each allocation list is accurate to each chunk
1. Add total value of chunk to chunk define screen.
1. Start with initial default value of 100% Inert.
1. Reduce the remaining allocation percentages in the picker after an allocation is set
1. Remove a set ore from the picker to prevent dupes.
1. Hook up the reset runs menu button to clear the data for the app.
1. Fix the ore allocation value amounts. They look wrong.
1. Find Ore from the Ore db rather than newing a fake one.
1. Allow editing of committed chunk
1. Add a distinctive name for each chunk
1. Add a mining area filter. Include as part of chunk name
