**TODO:** 
1. ~~Calculate chunk value for main screen.~~

1. ~~Change chunk Id at right time, so each allocation list is accurate to each chunk~~
1. ~~Add total value of chunk to chunk define screen.~~
1. Start with initial default value of 100% Inert.

1. Remove a set ore from the picker to prevent dupes.
1. ~~Hook up the reset runs menu button to clear the data for the app.~~
